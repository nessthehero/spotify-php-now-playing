<!--

This is an example of using Organisms and Molecules together to get a flexible component.

This module has a data source fixture called masthead.json, that is just passing that `context` to a partial, which will
parse the data and render the component.

We do this in order to maintain a module .html page in the project index to highlight the component, but also allow the
component to be reusable and accept data from other sources. The partial can store multiple variations of the module and
render a specific one based on certain data.

When using this method, keep the SCSS for this component in the module based SCSS file.

<!-- module:masthead -->
{{#parseFixture 'masthead.json'}}
	{{> masthead }}
{{/parseFixture}}
<!-- end module:masthead -->
